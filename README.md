<h2>What is this?</h2>
Inspired by the flexibility of the [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/) we wanted to enable the use of a few of its core features such as robust logging and the Topic/Subscriber architecture in a way that is more accessible and written 100% in Python. 

<p>Our goal is to bring intelligent robot control to everyone.</p>
